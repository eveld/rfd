# Request for discussion

## Summary
The purpose of this document is to introduce a RFD (Request for Discussion) process, designed to optimize decision-making by fostering collaboration and inclusivity. By implementing this process, we can improve our decision-making effectiveness, incorporate diverse perspectives and get better results.

## Background
Our current decision-making processes, while functional, occasionally struggle to encompass all viewpoints and thoroughly document the rationale behind decisions. We could use a more structured and inclusive framework to address these limitations. The RFD process allows us to create a systematic and transparent method for discussing and finalizing crucial decisions.

"Enhanced Transparency" through "Clear Documentation of Decision Rationale" ensures that the thought process and reasoning behind decisions are not only clear at the time of making the decision but are also adequately recorded for future understanding and reference, fostering accountability and informed decision-making.

"Inclusive Participation" involves actively encouraging and welcoming contributions from a wide range of individuals or groups involved in or affected by the decision-making process. 
Inclusive participation goes beyond merely inviting people to the discussion table. It's about actively cultivating an environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and integral to the decision-making process, fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect within the organization.
Acknowledging that each stakeholder brings unique insights based on their experiences, expertise, and roles. Embracing this diversity of perspectives can lead to more comprehensive and innovative solutions.
Ensuring that the process for defining product requirements values diverse perspectives, encourages collaboration, and aims for comprehensive, well-rounded requirements.

The RFD process embodies many of the principles of streamlined decision-making. It provides a structured, transparent, and inclusive framework for discussions and resolutions, ensuring that decisions are made efficiently and effectively within an organization.

RFD involves initiating discussions, engaging stakeholders, deliberating on proposals, and arriving at informed decisions.
